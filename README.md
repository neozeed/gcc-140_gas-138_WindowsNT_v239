While GCC on both OS/2 and MS-DOS were early products of the early 1990's I was just wondering why was Windows NT left out of the fun?

So with a lot of hacking I managed to get CC1 from GCC-1.40 & the Xenix GAS 1.38 assembler working on the latest 1991 Windows NT Pre-Releases
The upshot being that GCC *could* have been availbe on Windows NT the entire time it was public.
